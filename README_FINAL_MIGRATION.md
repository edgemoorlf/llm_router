# Final Migration Guide - Azure OpenAI Proxy

This guide outlines the final steps to complete the migration to the new implementation with separated configuration and state architecture for the Azure OpenAI Proxy.

## Background

The application has been updated to use a new instance management system with separated configuration and state. The initial migration phase involved running both old and new implementations side by side with a factory class for transitioning between them. This document covers the final steps to complete the migration by:

1. Removing backward compatibility with the old implementation
2. Simplifying the codebase
3. Updating API endpoints
4. Cleaning up unused files

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the final migration:

1. Ensure you have fully tested the new implementation
2. Create a backup of your current deployment
3. Have a rollback plan in place

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Cleanup Script

We've provided a cleanup script that:
- Creates a backup of your current files
- Updates import statements to use the new `instance_context` module
- Removes old implementation files
- Updates the `.env` file

```bash
python scripts/cleanup_old_implementation.py
```

### 2. Update Your API Client Scripts

If you have any scripts or clients that interact with the admin API, update them to use the simplified endpoints:

| Old Endpoint | New Endpoint |
|--------------|--------------|
| `/admin/instances/new/{name}/config` | `/admin/instances/{name}/config` |
| `/admin/instances/new/{name}/state` | `/admin/instances/{name}/state` |
| `/admin/instances/new` | `/admin/instances` |

### 3. Test the Application

After making these changes, start the application and verify everything is working:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Test the admin endpoints to ensure they're working properly:

```bash
# Get all instances
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/admin/instances" \
     -H "X-Admin-API-Key: your-admin-api-key"

# Get a specific instance
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/admin/instances/your-instance-name/config" \
     -H "X-Admin-API-Key: your-admin-api-key"
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Update your internal documentation to reflect the new API endpoints and architecture. The following files contain information about the new implementation:

- `docs/new_implementation.md` - Detailed documentation on the architecture
- `README.md` - Main project documentation

### 5. Clean Up Backup Files

Once you've verified everything is working correctly, you can remove the backup files created during the migration:

```bash
rm -rf backup_old_implementation/
```

## Key Files Changed

The following key files have been modified or created during the migration:

1. Added:
   - `app/instance/new_manager.py` - Instance manager with separated config and state
   - `app/instance/new_router.py` - Updated router implementation
   - `app/instance/instance_context.py` - Context module to prevent circular imports
   - `scripts/backup_monitor.py` - Script for backing up and monitoring config files
   - `scripts/cleanup_old_implementation.py` - Script to remove old implementation files
   - `docs/new_implementation.md` - Documentation for the new implementation

2. Removed:
   - `app/instance/factory.py` - Factory class for transitioning between implementations
   - `app/instance/manager.py` - Old instance manager implementation
   - `migration/initialize_new_implementation.py` - Migration script

3. Updated:
   - `app/main.py` - Simplified to use new implementation directly
   - `app/routers/admin.py` - Updated to use simplified endpoints
   - Various service modules - Updated import paths

## Benefits of The New Implementation

The fully migrated implementation offers several benefits:

1. **Clearer Architecture**: Separated configuration and state for better management
2. **Performance Improvements**: More efficient instance management and routing
3. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed transitional code, reducing complexity
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Better organized code with clearer responsibilities
5. **Enhanced Stability**: Better file-based persistence with backup capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after migration:

1. **API Endpoint Not Found**: Ensure you're using the updated endpoint paths
2. **Import Errors**: Check if any files still reference the old implementation paths
3. **Missing Instance Data**: Verify your config and state files are in the correct location

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the logs in your configured log directory.

## Conclusion

This completes the migration to the new implementation with separated configuration and state architecture. The application now uses a more robust and maintainable approach to instance management, with clearer separation of concerns and improved performance.
